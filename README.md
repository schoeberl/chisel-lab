# Lab Material for Chisel in Digital Electronics 2

This repository provides lab material for the
[Digital Electronics course (02139)](http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/courses/02139/) at DTU.
Although this lab is customized for the DTU course, it can also serve as
introduction lab for digital design with [Chisel](https://chisel.eecs.berkeley.edu/).

The lab is based on:
[Digital Design with Chisel](http://www.imm.dtu.dk/~masca/chisel-book.html), by Martin Schoeberl.

To use this material you can:
(1) download the repo as a .zip file,
(2) clone the repo to have all material offline (using it also for your solutions),
(3) fork the repo (and clone locally), to be able to contribute back with changes,
