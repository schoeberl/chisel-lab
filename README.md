# Lab Material for Chisel in Digital Electronics 2

This repository provides lab material for the
[Digital Electronics course (02139)](http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/courses/02139/) at DTU.
Although this lab is customized for the DTU course, it can also serve as
introduction lab for digital design with [Chisel](https://chisel.eecs.berkeley.edu/).

The lab is based on:
[Digital Design with Chisel](http://www.imm.dtu.dk/~masca/chisel-book.html),
first edition, by Martin Schoeberl.
